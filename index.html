    <p style="font-family:courier;"> Jellyfish are marine animals. They are shaped like umbrellas and have tentacles. Most jellyfish are mobile but there a few that are not. The tentacles of jellyfish have stinging cells. They use these tentacles to catch their prey. Jellyfish also use their tentacles for defense. </p>

    <p style="font-family:courier;"> Jellyfish feed on plankton, small fish, and crustaceans. They sting or paralyze the prey that they eat. They then flex their tentacles to bring the prey to their mouth. Most jellyfish are carnivorous. A few species of jellyfish are omnivorous. </p>

    <p style="font-family:courier;"> Most jellyfish live in the ocean but a few live in freshwater. Jellyfish typically float close to the surface of the water. Some jellyfish become trapped in saltwater lakes. There is a lake called Jellyfish Lake in Palau where many jellyfish have become trapped and now live there. </p>
